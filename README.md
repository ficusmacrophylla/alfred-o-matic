A simple webapp to monitor and manage your devices in a small/home network


What's Alfredo?

Have you ever forgot your file at home? Or simply needed an access to your computer network, or a simple checkup on your security cameras or IoT devices? No?

In that case, Alfredo can't help you. But if you have...here we are.

With a simple web based application you can add and manage almost any alfredo-enabled device on your Local Area Network. 
And, with proper configuration, you can even receive notifications while you are away. 

Give it a try. It's Alfredo.
